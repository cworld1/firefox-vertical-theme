# Firefox Paradise Theme

![startpage](https://github.com/nathandaven/startpage/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)


My custom Firefox userChrome profile, setup with right handed vertical tabs, compact layout, and MacOS/Paradise colors theming.

See [nathandaven/startpage](https://github.com/nathandaven/startpage) for my accompanying start page extension.

This is designed custom fit for me, so don't expect much configurability. See [here](https://github.com/ranmaru22/firefox-vertical-tabs) for a more standard configurable theme.

## Installation
1. locate the firefox profile folder by going to the *hamburger menu* > *help* > *more torubleshooting information*
2. click *show in finder* next to profile folder
3. open the highlighted folder (should look something like "13s123f4.default-release"
4. create a folder named "chrome"
5. paste files from repo into this folder and restart firefox (command-q and reopen)
6. install Tab Center Reborn
7. open the extension settings, enable compact mode, and copy the contents of `tab-center-reborn.css` into the stylesheet section
8. profit
